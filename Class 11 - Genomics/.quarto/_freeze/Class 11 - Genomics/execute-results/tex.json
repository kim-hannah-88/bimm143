Does the SNP effect the expression of ORMDL3?\n\nThere is some overlap between the expression values of the A/A and G/G genotypes, as seen by the whiskers of the boxplot. This suggests that there are individuals with the A/A genotype who exhibit expression levels similar to or even higher than some individuals with the G/G genotype. It can be inferred that the SNP does affect the expression of ORMDL3. The G/G genotype is associated with higher median expression levels and greater variability in expression compared to the A/A genotype.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Generate a boxplot\n# Generate a boxplot\nboxplot(exp ~ geno, data = data,\n        xlab = \"Genotype\",\n        ylab = \"Expression\",\n        main = \"Expression of ORMDL3 by Genotype\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Class-11---Genomics_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-2-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n",
